## üîß Professional Experience:

### üè¢ Pepperminds Danmark A/S

Pepperminds is a Dutch company that provides field marketing services to multiple businesses and associations,
during my time at Pepperminds the Danish branch was only taking on contracts from recognized Non-Governmental
Organizations (NGOs) and associations, so I took part in a campaign for B√∏rns Vilk√•r an organization that works
to improve the lives of children in Denmark.

### üè´ VIA University College

During my time at VIA, I became embedded into their student politics and social life. The student council is
traditionally
in charge of both student politics and social life on Campus. I was interested in both, but as the COVID-19 pandemic had
forced all social activities to close down, I found my niche in charge of reviving and improving life on campus.

For these purposes, I became the Chairman of the Events Committee and organized multiple parties where we had teams of
dozens of volunteers and hundreds of attendees. I learnt how to manage events for over 600 people and to manage teams of
over 100. Alongside my duties as organizer of all student run events on campus, I used my remaining spare time from work
and studies to volunteer at the Student Caf√© as a barista and at the Student Bar as a bartender.

Overall, I learnt first hand the value of leading by example, how to work around the constraints of a budget and stretch
it as much as possible and how to organize proper meetings and other events of varying sizes

## Personal Info:

I was born in Tenerife, the biggest of the Canary Islands belonging to Spain and situated far south, off the coast of
the African continent. I spent all my childhood there. After finishing high school, I moved to Denmark in order to study
Software Engineering at VIA University College. I've been passionately trying to build a career for myself in the
industry since. I am very friendly and social, I'm a member of the World Scouting Movement, a global brotherhood that
prides itself in honor, honesty, loyalty and austerity among other things. Through my studies, I'm becoming a
Software Engineer.

## Skills:

I have decided to split this section by field/relevance, as I feel it will be more useful for an overview and getting to
know me.

### Software Design:

I've learned how to read and use Unified Modelling Language (UML).
How to design pieces of software and to some degree, how to write effective documentation. I have leveraged my high
proficiency in both Spanish and English in order to write eloquent reports and easy-to-understand technical
documentation for my projects, getting better over time.

### Software Development

I have acquired much of knowledge multiple programming languages and frameworks both through my studies and my projects,
I have assembled a list sorted by my confidence in each of the following, this means that I'm more confident in the
elements at the top of the list.

- Java
- CSS
    - SASS (SCSS)
    - Bootstrap
- JavaScript
    - TypeScript
    - Electron
    - Node.js
    - JQuery
    - React
- API
    - REST
    - GRPC
- PostgreSQL
- C#
    - Blazor
    - .NET Framework
- Python

In my GitHub profile, you will find a list of all my public projects. Some of them I'm not proud of (class assignments,
old projects) while others I am more actively working on and thus, more satisfied with the result.

I am always open to any sort of question, feedback or proposition. I am open to work offers, freelance work and
volunteer projects. Find my contact information down below

## Interests:
I am a very avid gamer, I have been playing video games since I was 5 years old, I started fascinated by the Pok√©mon 
games, but swiftly moved towards Zelda, Assassin's Creed, The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Warframe, The Witcher, Watch Dogs, 
Rainbow Siege Six... Overall, I have always been a huge fan of Sandbox games, like Minecraft, Cities Skylines, Space 
Engineers, Scrap Mechanics.

Some gems I remember playing in my childhood are Sly, Jack and Daxter, Ratchet and Clank, 

I am also a fan of many media franchises like Dragon Ball, Star Wars among others.

I have read a fair share of books, specially during my teenage years, from classics like The Hunger Games or Divergent 
to the books that made me fall in love with the ancient world Percy Jackson (and other Rick Riordan books).

As for music, I often listen to different genres and my mood heavily influences the music I like, but pop, 
edm, and Kpop are infallible at making me smile.
