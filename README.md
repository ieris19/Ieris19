## Personal Info:

I was born in Tenerife, the biggest of the Canary Islands belonging to Spain and situated far south, off the coast of
the African continent. I spent all my childhood there. After finishing high school, I moved to Denmark in order to study
Software Engineering at VIA University College. I've been passionately trying to build a career for myself in the
industry since. I am very friendly and social, I'm a member of the World Scouting Movement, a global brotherhood that
prides itself in honor, honesty, loyalty and austerity among other things. Through my studies, I'm becoming a
Software Engineer.

## Projects:

In my GitHub profile, you will find a list of all my public projects. Highlights of these include:
### Personal Projects
* IerisLib: A Java library I have been developing throughout my path as a developer. It contains
  code I have found to be useful in more than one environment, or that I have wanted to show off.
  Not much of it has been used in public projects, but it has most definitely come in handy for my
  assignments
### School Projects:
* SEP4-5X-Cloud: A Java application designed as part of a larger project for my degree. It receives information from an
  embedded device, interacts with a MongoDB database where it is stored, and serves requests on a web API for easy 
  access through a website. It is accompanied by the sister repositories for the website and the embedded device:
  * [Embedded Device Repository](https://github.com/HighKingofMelons/Sep4IotDevice)
  * [Website Repository](https://github.com/selinaceban/club-environment-system-front-end)
