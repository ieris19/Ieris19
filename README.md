# About Myself

My name is Javier Abreu, although I often go by **Ieris19** on the internet.
I am a Software Engineering student based in Horsens, Denmark

## Personal Info:
I was born in Tenerife, the biggest of the Canary Islands, in Spain. I spent all
my childhood there. After finishing high school, I moved to Denmark in order to 
study Software Engineering at VIA University College. I've been passionately 
trying to build a career for myself in the industry since.  
I am very friendly and social, I'm a member of the World Scouting Movement and 
dedicated volunteer at the Student Council in my university, helping improve 
student life through events to promote interaction among students in the great
international environment that our campus provides. My role in the council usually
consists of organizing events and coordinating the teams of volunteers.

## Professional Info:
Through my volunteering, I've learned how to organize events of varying size,
work within the constraints of a budget, but more importantly, how to
effectively communicate with people, distribute tasks and balance the leadership
skills with the authority that comes alongside it.

Through my studies, I'm becoming a Software Engineer. I've learned how to read 
and use Unified Modelling Language (UML). How to design pieces of software and to
some degree, how to write effective documentation.

I have some degree of knowledge of the following languages, the list has been
sorted by my confidence in utilizing each of the following, this means that I'm
more proficient in the elements at the top of the list.
 - Java
 - HTML
 - CSS (Bootstrap)
 - JavaScript (JQuery)

### Portfolio: 
This repository contains some examples of source and documentation written about
them. However, for further references, my GitHub profile should contain other 
repositories, and I'm always open to questions and interviews

- I’m currently working on school assignments and personal projects.
- I’m currently learning more about Java, proper Software Design and Game 
  Development
